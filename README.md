🌦️ IBM – FE LIVE WEATHER DASHBOARD
🔹 Overview

IBM – FE Live Weather Dashboard is a front-end web application that displays real-time weather updates using public weather APIs.
It allows users to search by city name or GPS location, view current weather conditions, and see short-term forecasts on an interactive dashboard.

This project demonstrates how front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS) can be integrated with IBM / Weather Company APIs or OpenWeatherMap APIs to create a responsive, data-driven weather application.

🔹 Project Objectives

To design a simple and interactive front-end weather dashboard.

To fetch and display live weather data using APIs.

To enhance the user experience with clean design and responsive layout.

To implement location-based weather detection using Geolocation API.

To provide short-term weather forecasts for better usability.

🔹 Features

🌍 Live Weather Data – Real-time temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.

🔍 City Search Option – Users can enter any city name to view live weather.

📍 Use My Location – Detects and displays weather for current location.

📊 3-Day Forecast View – Displays upcoming weather summary with icons.

⚙️ Multiple API Providers – Supports IBM Weather Company API and OpenWeatherMap API.

💻 Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🔐 API Integration – Fetches JSON data from weather APIs securely via JavaScript.

🔹 How It Works

The user enters a city name or clicks “Use My Location.”

The frontend fetches data from the selected API endpoint.

The weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) is displayed in real time.

Forecast data for the next few days is shown with weather icons.

🔹 API Details
IBM Weather Company API Example:
https://api.weather.com/v3/wx/observations/current?
geocode={lat},{lon}&units=m&language=en-US&format=json&apiKey={YOUR_IBM_API_KEY}

OpenWeatherMap API Example:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={YOUR_API_KEY}&units=metric

🔹 Challenges & Solutions
Challenges	Solutions
Unstable sensor / API response	Added retry and error handling logic in JS.
CORS / API key exposure	Used backend proxy or limited public key for demo.
Responsive layout issues	Applied CSS grid & flexbox for better adaptability.
Data delay in display	Optimized fetch intervals and reduced re-render time.
🔹 Output Screenshots

🔹 Future Enhancements

Add hourly forecast and weather graphs.

Implement dark/light theme toggle.

Include air quality and sunrise/sunset data.

Integrate IBM Cloud Object Storage for data caching.

Deploy the project on GitHub Pages or IBM Cloud.

🔹 Learning Outcomes

API integration and asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch/Async Await).

DOM manipulation and event-driven UI design.

Understanding of JSON data and error handling.

Real-time application development with live data sources.
